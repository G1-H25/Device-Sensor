This directory is intended for PlatformIO Test Runner and project tests.

## Test Structure

### Native Tests (Cross-platform)
- **smoke/**: Basic functionality tests that verify components work without hardware dependencies
- **unit/**: Individual component unit tests that can run on any platform
- **integration/** (native): Component-level integration tests using native drivers

These tests focus on:
- Algorithm correctness
- Data structure behavior
- Component interactions at the API level
- Mocked hardware interactions

### Arduino-Only Tests
- **integration/arduino_*.cpp**: Full application integration tests requiring Arduino hardware

These tests require:
- Arduino BLE hardware
- GPIO pin access
- Arduino timing services
- Real sensor hardware

## Running Tests

### Native Tests
```bash
pio test -e native
```

### Arduino Tests
```bash
pio test -e arduino
```

## Test Philosophy

Following the main program structure in `main.cpp`:
- Native tests verify individual components and their interactions
- Arduino tests verify the complete `SensorApp` application lifecycle
- Tests follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- No repeating act-assert blocks within single tests
